            <p>Hello! My name is Sofia Canihuante, an Anthropology and Data Science senior at UT Austin.</p>
            <p>I have experience with Java, JavaScript, R, RStudio, and Python. I also have experience with a myriad of machine learning techniques used on real world data to make actionable insight. I am passionate about solving technical problems with an interdisciplinary approach.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in program management, project management, product management, trust and safety, data analytics, and security-related roles.</p>
            <p>I am also interested in graduate school programs that include social and behavioral data analytics research.</p>
            <p>As a small business owner and club officer, I’ve gained leadership, strategic planning, and communication skills, along with experience in problem-solving and decision-making. In my free time, I enjoy visiting different resturants and exploring new cusines. I also have a passion for reading and exploring new places in my free time, with my curiosty driving me to constantly learn and adapt as I expand my horizons.</p>
